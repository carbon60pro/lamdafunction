  lamda function  - start 
  lamda function - stop 
  once machine are up , initiate handling

  once patching is completed , test url. test nginx 
  on demand patching.

     stag stage or offline 
     testing should only proceed when state is offline.

     processes:

we are looking for an expert experinced with writing lamda functions  that can perform the following
 1. start  ec2 instances 
 2. performs patching 
 3. alerts if the patching fails
 4. Test if patching was successful after patching 
 5. stop the instances.
    Not.
we prefer for the function  to only run when the servers are offline. so in this case we need to 
          a. use some tags or  if, else statements.
The task can be performed either with cloud formation template or terraform.
